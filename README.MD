## Intro To Project

- This project was made to complete the assignment `Phase 4 Project` for the `SE-West-091123` class for the [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/) Software Engineering Boot Camp.
- The project was completed using the following: `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, `React`, `React Router`, `Formik`, `Yup`, and `Bcrypt`.

## Starting the Application

- Fork and clone this repo, and open in your favorite code editor.
- In one terminal window:
  - Run `pipenv install && pipenv shell` to install packages and enter virtual environment.
  - Run `touch .env` in the main directory and open the new file.
  - In the `.env` file, insert `FLASK_RUN_PORT = 5555`,  `APP_SECRET = `
  - Enter the Flask shell using `flask shell`, then run `import secrets`, then `secrets.token_hex(32). Copy the output code.
  - Paste the code after `APP_SECRET = <paste here>` and exit the shell with `Ctrl-D`.
  - Enter the server directory using `cd server` and run `python seed.py`. It may take a moment to seed the database!
  - Run `python app.py` to start the server.
- In a second terminal window:
  - Enter the client directory using `cd client`, and run `npm i && npm start` to install necessary packages and start the program.
